# Personal-Expense-Tracker
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses effectively. This python application allows you to do so. This application will allow you to:
1. Add expense(s): You can enter an expense with its appropriate details. You will have to enter the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), category (Food, Travel, Entertainment, etc), amount and a small description of the expense. You can enter multiple expenses if you wish to do so. These expenses are stored in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount and decription as key-value pairs.
2. View expense(s): You can view all the current expenses you have entered.
3. Set and track a budget: You can enter a monthly budget and the program will tell you if you're within or over your budget.
4. Save and load expenses: You can save your expenses into a prenamed csv file. The program will read this csv file and store its contents so that way you can resume where you left off. 

There are defined functions for each task. There is a main menu which will be shown after each operation is done. The user can choose to do another operation or log out whenever they need to.
